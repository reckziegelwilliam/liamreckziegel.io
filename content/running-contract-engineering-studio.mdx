## The Studio Model

Running a contract engineering studio sits between freelancing and a traditional agency:

**Not Freelance**:
- Systematized processes
- Reusable components and templates
- Higher project rates
- Productized services

**Not Agency**:
- Lean team (1-3 people)
- Lower overhead
- Direct client relationships
- Technical depth over breadth

## Numbers After 6+ Years

<MetricsGrid metrics={[
  { value: '50+', label: 'Websites' },
  { value: '20+', label: 'Apps Built' },
  { value: '$2M+', label: 'Revenue' },
  { value: '65%', label: 'Repeat Business' }
]} />

- **Average project**: $15K-50K
- **Team size**: 1-2 (depending on workload)

<Alert type="success">
The studio model offers the best of both worlds: freedom and flexibility of freelancing with the stability and higher rates of an agency. Perfect for technical founders who want sustainable income without managing a large team.

## Tech Stack Philosophy

### Core Principle: Optimize for Maintenance

**Bad**: Bleeding edge tech that requires constant updates
**Good**: Stable, well-documented frameworks with large communities

### Primary Stack (2024)

```typescript
const productionStack = {
  // Frontend
  framework: 'Next.js 14',
  styling: 'Tailwind CSS',
  components: 'shadcn/ui',
  
  // Backend
  api: 'Next.js API Routes or tRPC',
  database: 'PostgreSQL (Supabase)',
  orm: 'Drizzle or Prisma',
  
  // Mobile
  mobile: 'React Native (Expo)',
  
  // Hosting
  web: 'Vercel',
  backend: 'Railway or Fly.io',
  storage: 'AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2',
  
  // Services
  auth: 'NextAuth.js or Clerk',
  payments: 'Stripe',
  emails: 'Resend',
  analytics: 'Plausible',
};
```

**Why This Stack?**

1. **Developer Experience**: Fast builds, hot reload, TypeScript
2. **Client Handoff**: Easy for other devs to maintain
3. **Cost Effective**: Generous free tiers, predictable pricing
4. **Performance**: Excellent Core Web Vitals out of the box
5. **Community**: Large ecosystem, easy to hire help

### Component Library Strategy

Build reusable components across projects:

```typescript
// Shared component library
const sharedComponents = [
  'Button',
  'Input',
  'Modal',
  'Card',
  'NavBar',
  'Footer',
  'ContactForm',
  'AuthForms',
  'Dashboard',
  'DataTable',
  'FileUpload',
];

// Client projects use customized versions
import { Button, Input } from '@studio/components';
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster project delivery
- Consistent quality
- Easy updates across projects
- Showcase-able portfolio

## Client Management

### Discovery Process

**Initial Call** (30 min, free):
- Understand the problem
- Assess fit (technical + personal)
- Ballpark budget discussion

**Detailed Proposal** (if good fit):
- Scope document (features, deliverables)
- Timeline with milestones
- Fixed price or hourly estimate
- Payment terms (50% upfront, 50% on completion)

**Contract** (always):
- Scope of work
- Timeline and milestones
- Payment schedule
- Revision policy (2-3 rounds included)
- Post-launch support terms
- IP assignment

### Communication Cadence

**During Build**:
- **Weekly updates**: Friday email with progress + next week
- **Demo sessions**: Every 2 weeks (Loom or call)
- **Slack/Email**: Response within 24 hours

**Post-Launch**:
- **Support window**: 30-90 days depending on project
- **Monthly retainer** (optional): 10 hours/month for updates

### Managing Scope Creep

**Strategy**: Fixed scope with change request process

```typescript
// Change request template
interface ChangeRequest {
  description: string;
  reasoning: string;
  estimatedHours: number;
  estimatedCost: number;
  impactOnTimeline: string;
  clientApproval: boolean;
}
```

**Example**:
> "Adding user roles (admin/user/guest) was not in the original scope. This will require 12 hours ($1,800) and extend the timeline by 1 week. Please approve to proceed."

## Pricing Strategy

### Hourly vs Fixed Price

**Hourly** ($150-250/hr):
- Ongoing retainers
- Undefined scope
- Exploration/prototyping

**Fixed Price** (preferred):
- Well-defined projects
- Predictable for client
- Higher profit margins if efficient

### Project Pricing Formula

```
Base Hours × Hourly Rate × Complexity Multiplier × Risk Buffer

Example Website:
80 hours × $175/hr × 1.2 (custom design) × 1.15 (buffer) = $19,320

Round to: $19,500 or $20,000
```

**Risk Buffer**: Account for unknowns (15-25%)

### Retainer Pricing

**Monthly Retainer** (10-20 hours/month):
- Updates and maintenance
- Small feature additions
- Bug fixes
- Technical support

**Pricing**:
- 10 hours: $1,500/month
- 20 hours: $2,800/month
- Unused hours roll over (max 2 months)

## Project Workflow

## Automation & Systems

### Project Template

```bash
# Starter template with everything configured
git clone https://github.com/studio/nextjs-starter client-project
cd client-project
npm install
npm run setup # Interactive setup script

# Prompts for:
# - Project name
# - Client info
# - Database (Y/N)
# - Auth (Y/N)
# - Payments (Y/N)
# - CMS (Y/N)

# Generates configured Next.js app in 5 minutes
```

### Automated Deploys

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Staging
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
```

### Client Dashboard

Simple status page for all active projects:

```typescript
// dashboard.studio.com
const projects = [
  {
    client: 'Client A',
    status: 'In Development',
    progress: 65,
    nextMilestone: 'User dashboard complete',
    stagingUrl: 'https://client-a.vercel.app',
  },
  // ...
];
```

## Scaling Challenges

### Problem 1: Too Much Work

**Solutions**:
1. **Raise rates**: Fewer clients, same revenue
2. **Hire contractor**: For overflow work
3. **Narrow focus**: Say no to non-ideal projects

### Problem 2: Inconsistent Revenue

**Solutions**:
1. **Retainer clients**: Predictable monthly income
2. **Pipeline management**: Always be closing next project
3. **Savings buffer**: 3-6 months runway

### Problem 3: Burnout

**Solutions**:
1. **Project limits**: Max 2-3 active projects
2. **Downtime**: Block 1-2 weeks between projects
3. **Productize**: Turn custom work into SaaS (long-term)

## Marketing & Lead Generation

### What Works

**1. Referrals** (60% of leads):
- Happy clients refer friends
- Incentivize with discount on next project
- Ask explicitly after successful launch

**2. Portfolio Site** (25% of leads):
- Case studies with results
- Tech stack highlighted
- Clear pricing/contact CTA

**3. LinkedIn** (10% of leads):
- Share project updates
- Write technical posts
- Engage with target audience

**4. Partnerships** (5% of leads):
- Design agencies need developers
- Marketing agencies need technical execution
- Revenue share or referral fee

### What Doesn't Work (for me)

- ❌ Cold outreach
- ❌ Upwork/Fiverr (race to bottom)
- ❌ Pay-per-click ads
- ❌ Social media ads

## Tools & Software

### Development
- **Editor**: VS Code
- **Design**: Figma
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Hosting**: Vercel, Railway, Fly.io
- **Database**: Supabase, Neon

### Business
- **Contracts**: PandaDoc
- **Invoicing**: Stripe Invoicing
- **Time Tracking**: Toggl
- **Project Management**: Linear or Notion
- **Communication**: Slack, Email (Hey.com)

### Cost: ~$150/month total

## Financial Model

### Revenue (Example Year)

```
10 websites @ $12K avg = $120K
6 web apps @ $25K avg = $150K
2 mobile apps @ $35K avg = $70K
4 retainer clients @ $2K/mo = $96K

Total: $436K revenue
```

### Expenses

```
Software/Tools: $1,800/year
Contractors (occasional): $30K/year
Healthcare: $8K/year
Taxes (self-employment): $90K/year
Office/Equipment: $3K/year

Total: ~$133K expenses
```

### Net: ~$303K (before personal income tax)

**Effective Rate**: $250/hr working 30 hours/week

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Specialize Your Stack
Mastering one stack beats being mediocre at five. Clients pay for expertise.

### 2. Price on Value, Not Hours
A $20K website that generates $200K in leads is a steal.

### 3. Good Clients > More Clients
One great client worth more than five difficult ones. Fire bad clients.

### 4. Document Everything
Saves hours explaining the same thing. Clients appreciate it.

### 5. Automate Ruthlessly
Starter templates, deployment scripts, email templates—automate repetitive work.

### 6. Build Relationships
Repeat business is easier than new business. Stay in touch.

### 7. Know When to Say No
Misaligned projects drain energy. Trust your gut.
